Things I used in this page:
- Flexbox
- Form
- "a"(anchors) with a button style

Things that I found hard:
- Scaling, when resize the page or changing its scale, I don't know what type of scale I should use, "rem" or "em" or "%", especially with images 
- I do know how to do "media queries" but since there are problems( I guess) with the original size, I won't change it yet, but I'll do it and I'll update this page
- I didn't created a folder to store all this scripts and images and I really should, but I recently learned this method of "@import" the scripts into a single one
