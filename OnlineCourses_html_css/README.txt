Things in this page:
- Flexbox
- position relative and absolute
- some ":hover" effects 
- navbar 

Things to improve:
- scaling and "media queries"
- better use of the design that I copied
- I could use a "hamburger menu" but I heard that It would be better using Javascript, so I didn't use it, but I could using a click on a false checkbox.
- If I had more than one page and a hundred of images and scripts I would probably use folders to store the content, but I should do it anyway because it is a good thing to get use to
